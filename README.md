## Intro

A web frontend built on Next.js that provides a web API for various client applications (e.g. a web frontend) that facilitate the coaching and mentoring of software engineers.

The platform itself is useful for professional independent coaches, informal mentors and engineering leaders who work with individual software engineers and/or teams by providing a single application that facilitates and enhances your coaching practice.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) with your browser to log in to the platform.
